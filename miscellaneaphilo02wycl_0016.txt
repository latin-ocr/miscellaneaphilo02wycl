XII INTRODUCTION.

is necessarily God! (p. 14, l. 30 to end3 p. 15, l. 1—20). It is impossible
to know who were the ‘modern logicians and theologians' against whom
this sharp retort was directed. If we consult St. Thomas (Sum. Theol.
p. 111„ qu. 4, art. 1. Ad secundum) we find that he denies that brutes
are ‘assumpfible' by any Divine Person. What is not capable of a lesser
perfection‚ is not capable of a greater. A body incapable of sensitive
life must also be incapable of reason. Brutes are incapable of being
united to God by knowing and loving Him3 therefore they must be
incapable of the infinitely greater hypostatic union. The argument would
seem to imply absolute impossibility. But St. Thomas only concludes:
“Creatura rationalis . . . non habet congruitatem . . .'’ thus leaving in doubt
the question whether the ‘assumption' is or is not impossible to God's
absolute power. I must add, however, that I have only been able to
consult the Summa Theologica. It is well known that theologians do not
like to ascribe any bounds to God’s omnipotence short of the clearest
contradiction in terms‚ and they distinguish carefully between ‘potentia
absoluta' and the ‘potentia ordinata’ or controlled by Infinite Wisdom.
For myself, I do not see that anything implying the negation of Infinite
Wisdom fails to be a contradiction in terms; for it would amount to the
denial of God‘s existence.

Chapter JV. The beauty of the Ideal World is God's own beauty;
therefore infinite, An existing creature is not infinitely beautiful, and in
this sense is not identical with its Ideal and Eternal exemplar. But it is
notwithstanding eternally intelligible3 and this eternal intelligibility‚ existing
before its temporal entity, really belongs to it, though not quei temporally
existing. It is therefore true to say that the ass is its Idea, is eternal,
infinitely beautiful, etc. if we keep cautiously to the sense in which this
is true, and avoid scandalizing those who cannot or will not understand
this doctrine. On one hand, the being of the ass, as existing hic et nunc,
differs from its Ideal Form; on the other, as eternally intelligible, it is
the same (p. 16—19‚ l. 10). There are dialectical difficultIes in the way,
but they are not insurmountable (p. 19, l. 10—29).

Are these Ideals absolute or relative forms? Absolute, since their
existing copies are absolute. If relative, they would be relative to their
copies alone3 and this cannot be, since the accident of the existence
of their copies makes no difference in their own entity. Resides, we
cannot class them with relations, which are the most imperfect of all
