XXVIII INTRODUCTION.

proposition, making it true figuratively. Was the goat which Abraham
sacrificed figuratively Christ, since it was a figure of Christ? No, for not
every figure is figuratively identical with the thing it represents, Some
are, some are not; God alone knows why. Such a form of predication
is only true within its own limits3 if taken to mean another kind os
predication‚ it becomes false (p. 82, l. 20 to p. 84, 1. 10). — This
theory, from some points of view, is identical with that which in Wyclif’s
later works served him to explain the Eucharistic Presence of Christ.
But in the latter he maintains that the ‘figurative identity’‚ really true,
can be called real3 and in De Apostczsia he even maintains that the
Paschal Lamb, being the figure of Christ, was Christ, though less per-
fectly so than the Host. These developments naturally sprang from the
idea here already expressed‚ that Christ's words have the power of
bestowing on a subject and a predicate some sort of identity that could
not exist without them.

Here he openly combats the assumption that ‘truly’ means ‘really’.
If it did, since the Father is truly different from the Divine Essenee, He
would be really so, Probably Wyclif came later to find this distinction
untenable‚ since the Father is not truly different from the Godhead, but
only according to our imperfect mode of thinking, which distinguishes
what is identical in itself, just as we think separately of Edward VII and
of the King of England. And this is the more likely when we find him
admitting that his sketch of the matter is inadequate, and requires com-
pletion and possibly correction (p. 84, l. 10 to p. 85, l. 29).

We prove these three degrees of predication by the principle that
all difference of perfecffion, such as may be found in predication‚ implies
not only a positive, but a comparative and a superlative as well. And
as, taking a greater, a less and a least within each of these degrees of
entitative perfectiori, we have the nine choirs of Angels, so we get nine
degrees of predicative union, of which examples are given. There are
also other divisions in this matter (p. 85‚ l. 29 to end of chapter).

Chapter XIV. The so-called Expositorial Syllogism being closely
connected with predication‚ Wyclif here proceeds to examine it. Its
general form requires the middle term to be a singular, and it is much
used in different ways to a combat the theory of Universals, Leaving the
detailed examination of this syllogism to another tractate, various fallacics
proceeding more or less from the abuse os this argument will here be
