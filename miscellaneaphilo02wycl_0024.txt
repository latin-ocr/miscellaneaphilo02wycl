XX INTRODUCTION.

Wyclif points out that his theory easily explains the existence of
a more universal form (v. g. Life) in one less universal (Humanity for
example); the former extends to the latter as the divine Essence extends
to the Father. —- I believe, however, that the doctrine which made of
God a Universal of which the Three Persons are the particulars had
already been condemned by the Catholic Church3 and therefore this
could only have been meant by Wyclif as an analogy. But if only an
analogy, it does not seem at all easy to point out the difference‚ since
he takes the Trinity and the relations of the Three Persons with each
other and with the Godhead as the central point of his system. If
these relations are identical with those of the Universals and their par-
ticulars, is it not natural to conclude that the Divine Essence must be
a Universal? — A Universal which does not exist in each of its indi-
viduals — such, for instance as Plato's Ideal Man, which led Aristotle
to deny all reality to Universals -— is impossible; that is, impossible
naturally3 whether, like the accidents in the Sacrament of the Altar‚ it
can be miraculously sustained in existence without existing in any par-
ticular, is doubtfu13 at any rate, it has an existence of its own, far nobler
than that of its subjects (p. 40, l. 12 to p. 41, l. 25), Note here again
how explicitly Wyclif states his belief in the doctrine of Absolute Acci-
dents, of which he was soon to see the incompatibility with his perfected
system. The chapter ends with a few remarks concerning ‘Grammatical'
Universals, which are merely the words used to mean a Universal idea
or thing3 and also concerning another division, given by Grosseteste
(p. 41, l. 25 to p. 42, l. 13).

Chapter VIII. Here the author begins by enumerating a series of
objections (p. 43 to p. 44, l. 11), to which, both here and in the
following chapters, he replies at great length. As he however answers
them in a very diffuse manner, and without any further reference to
them⁷ it is unnecessary to state them here.

A great many ideas, such for instance as God, Being‚ etc. though
universals in Wyclif's theory, are not comprised under genera and species,
as Universals should be. —-- To answer this would be difficult if we
accept the usual definition‚ We ought rather to say that “A Universal is
a thing, capable of being predicated as one form existing iu many
separately, and of those many which are as it were its matter and its
subjectffl. If we take this definition⁷ and start from any particular sub-
