Abstract and the Concrete, differenee in
sense between the, 161.

Abstractz'on‚ Universals by, 1773 these
exist, but there are others too, which
have entity of their own, apart from
that of our thinking act, 180.

Accidents have genera, but not properly,
713 yet their entity is real, 725 they
are defined as what may be pre·-
sent or absent without entailing the
destruction of the subject in either
case, 753 some are inseparable in fact

separated therefrom in thought, 76;
which in the case of the other four
Universals is impossible, 77.

893 says that white signifies whiteness
