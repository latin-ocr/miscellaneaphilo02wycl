XL INTRonUCTION.

quently, that All positive entities (omne genitum) have eterna] existence
(esse) p. 167—168. We cannot, of anything that has existed or will
exist (positive entities‘l say absolutely, “This does not exist”. Since it is
eternally „true that it will exist or has existed, the ‘will exist' or ‘has
existed' is eterna13 and this truth being {dentical with entity, some entity
must therefore be everlastingly predicable of this being, and no absolute
negation of its existence can be true. Therefore everything exists (in a
sense) eternally; but we must distinguish between its intelligible existence,
its becomiug, and its specific being, Only the first is everlasting. Thus
far Wyclis, but it is easily conceivable that his followers may have pro·-
ceeded farther. For the ‘becoming’ of any being is eternally true, and
so is its specific being3 and if we distinguish between its ‘intelligible
becoming’ and its ‘becoming as a fact'‚ then it may be urged that ‘be-
coming as a fact' is also eternally true. The argument might be continued
indefinitely‚ with an indefinite number of distinctions, neither assailant
nor defendet· being worsted.

V. Analysis ot De Materia.

Though the text of this tractate is less corrupt than that of the
former three, if we consider each sentence in particular, it is not less
difficult to analyze than they are. There is a great gap, —- Ι think
between pages 172 and 1733 indeed it would seem as though what
precedes p. 173 has no connection whatever with the rest of the
treatise. The title, De Materia, is merely conjectural (see Shirley's Cata-
logue) and nothing more is said about matter after p. 172. This indeed
is not a sufficient reason to conclude that these two parts are fragments
of different treatises, for Wyclis is often given to wandering far from his
subject3 but it authorizes us in analyzing the two parts separately.

First Part (p. 170—173). Primal matter never can be a predicate.
This means, not that we cannot say of any given body, This is matter;
but that it is the first underlying subject of all forms3 all forms or
determinations are therefore predicable of it, and not vice versa. We say
truly‚ This is matter, but then we mean determined matter, not the first
underlying subject. The question is, whether this primordia] matter is
absolutely formless in its essence. Wyclis proceeds to solve the problem,
noting the different terms used to denote matter, form, and compound,
