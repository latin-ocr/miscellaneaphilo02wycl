XVI INTRODUCTION.

Contradiction3 the denial is merely verbal‚ not real. Our own nature
irresistibly impels us to admit the Universals3 and since we cannot
destroy nature, why not yield to it? (p. 31, l. 28 to end of chapter).
Chapter VII. We have then Universal Entity, first object of the
mind, predicated in many and of many subjects, yet not belonging to
any of the five Predicables (Genus, Species, Difference, Property⁷ and
Accident) though more truly existing in its subjects than any of these3
and also, by that same existence in a subject, distinct from the Ideal
Exemplars, which have no such formal existence. As God is a common
Form in the Three Divine persons, so Entity is a common form in every
being without exception (ρ. 33). — In the marginal notes I put inadver-
tently, “Somewhat like the Deity”‚ ete. Ι now think that the restrictiori
ought to be erased; and indeed there is nothing in the text to imply
any restriction. If we go through Wyclif’s philosophical works, we shall
always find him consistently defending his position by reference to the
Divine Essence and the Holy Trinity. The genesis of his system may
perhaps be stated thus. He had arrived at the conviction that there are
Real Universals‚ and Entity, the most universal of all3 the subordinate
Universals are distinct one from another somehow, and somehow from
the supreme Universal⁷ Entity, What was the distinction, and how was
it to be understood so as neither to fall into Pantheism on one hand,
non to the denial of reality to the Universals on the other? Here Wyclif
bethought him of the mystery of the Holy Trinsty, in which the Divine
Essence is each of the Three Persons, distinct therefrom only by a
logical distinction (distinctio rationis), whilst the Three are really distinct
from each other, though One in the Unity of God. If (we may suppose
he thought) Entity is assumed as the common form of all beings‚ God
and His creatures alike, which are notwithstanding really different from
each other, as the Father is different from the Son, we have a stand-
point that is impregnable, since any argument to prove that such a
distinction is absurd would be tantamount to a denial of the doctrine of
the Church. As there are Three Persons in One God, so there are
many particulars and One Being. He thus avoided saying that ‘Man is
God’, since (in his view) there is the same relation between Man and
God, as between the Father and the Son3 now the Father is not the
Son. Yet they are both the same Being, just as both the Father and
the Son are God. This of course was open to the objection that he
