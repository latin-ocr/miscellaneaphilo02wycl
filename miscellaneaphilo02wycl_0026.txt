XXII INTRODUCTION.

bably a mistake of the copyist, if not of the writer, who, we must
remember‚ was very young and inexperienced - is that Humanity, one
in itself, is not one but many in its singulars3 so that there is not one
man but many. There is only a formal (not a real) distinction between
the individual humanity and the singular man, between the white individual
and his individual whiteness. Persons differ in respect of their singular
humanities; otherwise we might say that there was only one singular
man; which is false and heretical. But singular attributes, unlike those
which are universal, add nothing to the perfection of the being which
possesses them (p. 50—52, 1. 7).

Thus a given man is identical with his humanity, his animality, and
his rationality3 but these are not identical with one another; just as every
compound nature is at the same time matter, form⁷ and compound‚ vand
yet these three are not the same, though having the same essence.
Matter means a being in its lowest, form the same being in its highest
degree of perfection; and the compound itself is that being considered
both ways. Each of these is therefore the same individual thing viewed
from different standpoints (p. 52, l. 7 to p. 53, l, 95. Thus, whilst in
intelligent beings three things of the same nature (memory, intelligence
and will, as is more than once expounded in Wyclif’s works) form an
image of the Trinity‚ there is in all beings a vestige of the Trinity,
caused by things that are not of the same nature —- genus, species,
and difference, which in man correspond to animality, humanity and
rationality, one underlying the other which determines it, and the two
together forming the species (p. 53, l. 9 to end of page).

From p. 54 to p. 57, a discussion concerning the relations between
higher and lower Universals results at the end of the chapter in the
assertion that they differ as one ‘formalitas‘ (taken in the sense of Duns
Scotu’s theory) differs from another. The arguments are in great part
unintelligible to my mind3 but perhaps the reader may find a clue to
understand them if I set forth here very briefly what I know about that
once famous and now forgotten theory. It amounts, however, to very
little. Scholastics before Scotus used to admit the distinctio rationis and
the distinctio realis. The former was a mere distinction between a thing
considered in one way and the same thing considered in another way.
It was divided into distinctio rationis ratiocinantis, in which the difference
in consideration is based, not upon anything in the nature of the thing
