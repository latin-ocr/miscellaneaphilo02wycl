IV. Analysis of the Notae et Questiones Variae.

It is almost impossible to analyze 3 text so corrupt as this. It is
better then to take the two most salient passages. From p. 158 to
p. 161. Wyclif examines the question whether every truth has a corre-
sponding falsehood. By falsehood we cannot mean non-entity, for then
we would mean nothing (p. 1597 1. 5—10); it is an entity, the belief that
something which is, is not. Now the First Truth (There exists a God)
can have no corresponding salsehood, since that would be an entity, and
absolutely bad, even as God is absolutely good; but nothing is absolutely
bad. Nor can the Second Truth (Creatures exist) have a corresponding
falsehood. That‚ if it existed, would be the worst of all things; and
there is no such ‘worst’. -— And consequently since these truths, which
are entities‚ make up the sum of being, no truth can have an opposite
falsehood: for uo entity has a contradictory non-entity. — Waiving for
a moment the peculiar theories os Wyclif’s system, we cannot but admit
that this last argument sheds light upon many a modern controversy,
Hegel has affirmed‚ as all know, that Being and Non-Being are one and
the same, since to be thought of is to be, and Non-Being is thought of.
As Wyclif points out, Non-Being is not, and cannot be, the contradictory
of Being. When we say Some Non-Being is a Being, we say true in a
certain sense3 when we say, Some Not man is a man, we say what
cannot possibly be true. Yet the first proposition, as it stands, looks as
sels-contradictory as the second. As a matter of fact, Being is not taken
in the same sense in the subject as Being in the predicate; we have two
different terms, though there is a certain analogy between them. The
Principle of Contradiction (pace Hegem) thus remains unassailable, since
it only affirms that you cannot assert and deny at the same time the
same thing in the same sense. Non-Being is something thought of, but it
is not thought of in the same way as Being thought of without the
negahon, In the same way, if it should be said: What is not thought of
is thought of: “It is‚’' we answer, “but it is thought of negatively‚ whilst
the predicate leought os embraces every manner of thinking.'' These
subtleties are worth while nofieing, since the name of their inventor is
Hegel.

Another point, which touches the very essence of WycliPs theory,
is that All positive entities exist in one first mode of being, and conse-
