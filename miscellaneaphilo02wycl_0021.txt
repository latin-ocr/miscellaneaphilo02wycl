INTRODUCTION. XVII

solved the whole question of Universals by constant reference to the
most obscure mystery in the whole Christian faith3 not to speak of
many other secondary difficulties which he spent his life—time in trying
to surmount‚ and his explanation of which finally put him in opposition
with many doctrines of the Church. Nevertheless, it may be frankly said
that amongst all the many shades of more or less extreme Realism, that
which Wyclif expounded seems perhaps the most reasonable; or, if you
prefer, the least unreasonable. Of the theory of Moderate Realism‚ which
touches Conceptualism on one side, and exaggerated Realism on the
other, avoiding the difficulties of each system, and expounded and upheld
by the greatest masters of Scholastic thought, I have already written
much, both in Logical, vol. ΙΙ, pp, XI—Xffl, and in Misc. Phil. vol. Ι,
Preliminary Essay, pp. XXVI—XXVII.

Wyclif subsequently plunges into a disquisition upon the three
kinds of UniversaIS. As there is Metaphysical‚ Logical, and Grammatical
truth‚ so there are three kinds of universality, strictly corresponding to
these (p. 36, l. 1—17). A Metaphysical Universal is that which is common
to many3 a Logical Universal is that which is only thought as common
to many3 it results from our power of abstraction from particulam, and
has no existence save in the thinking mind. But it is that by which
we know the Real Universa13 for it must stand for something, and
that something can neither be our own mind nor the abstractive act
which it produces, neither being universal (ib. l. 17 to end p. 37,
l. 1-12). The argument is excellent, and in my opinion admits of no
reply3 but it does not prove that the Universal is, in existing and con-
crete things, anything more than ‘a fundamental possibility of being ab·
stracted by the mind’‚ which is the theory of Moderate Realists.

Of this last theory Wyelif, absorbed in his struggles with the
Nominalists⁷ either does not speak at all (at least in the works that I
have seen) or he deals with it in the following paragraphs. If so, he
shows that he never understood it, or was only imperfectly acquainted
with that doctrine. He considers it as the theory of those who make
all universality to consist in mere Logical abstraction (“negant in rebus
universalitatem metaphysicam'' p. 30, l. 4), thus treating it as pure
Conceptualism. And I am the more justified in thinking that he meant by
these words the Moderate Realism of Aristode, of Alexander Hales, of

Aquinas and Duns Scotus and a host of others, since we find him ad-
De Universalibus. Β
