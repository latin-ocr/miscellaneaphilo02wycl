INTRODUCTION. IX

World. This must be admitted unless we refuse to believe in God’s
omniscience (p. 6, l. 1—28). God's knowledge must be of something
necessarily existing7 since His knowledge exists necessarily; if then this
object be not the Ideal World, it must be the world as we know it,
our world: but this does not exist necessarily. Each created being
is distinct from others, and so has a distinet intelligibility; the Divine
Essence cannot by itself be identical with all these different objects.
As one seal stamps only one species of impression, so God must have
other patterns besides His Essence to stamp the multitude of creatures
with (ib., l. 28, 293 p. 7, l. 1—35). It is absurd to say that an Infinite
Artist requires no model for His creations. On the contrary, the greater

the artist, the more perfect his mental pattern is (p. 8, l. 7—15). Only
in the case of a finite artist the mental pattern is not eterna13 with the

Infinite Artist, it is eternal or is not at all (ib, l. 15—38). The
distinctness of God’s knowledge of all things in Himself implies a mul-
titude of ideas; if there were only a few, or one, the knowledge would
be confused. And what of God’s knowledge of things that never were,
nor will be, but only might be? The object of that knowledge must be
in Himself7 or not exist at all. We must therefore admit an Ideal World,
if we admit that anything can exist (p. 9, l. 1—60).

Note by the way that Wyclif here openly admits the possibility
of things that never are nor will be. As we have shown elsewhere, this
is in conflict with this more matured system. Even in the present work
(Ch. XXI, p. 131) we find Wyclif asserting that every Universal must
at some time or other exist in its own proper foram· and yet more
clearly (p. 137) that every species must at some time or other really
exist. He had not yet extended his conclusion to every possible particular
being3 but the drift of his argument was already leading him that way.

Chapter III. Wyclif here adds several remarks, designed to forestall
objections which might be made to his doctrine of an Ideal World.
It contains in itself a vast multitude of forms that differ really amongst
themselves, and may therefore be called different realities in God3
although the Catholic faith allows us only to call the Three Divine
Persons Things (res). Their difference is not, like that of the Three
persons, a numerical difference (so at least I understand the term sup-
positalz‘ter, p. 10, l. 34, though it may be understood as a differenee
of subject, supposition), nor of essenee, like that of God and His
