creatures. One is not the other, and they are therefore really different
though in the same subject. They are identical with the Divine Essence
by eternal communication (emanation?), and therefore cannot properly be
called God, like one of the Three Divine Persons3 but this eternal
communication of the Deity makes them to be God in a restricted sense.
As Augustine says, they are Life in God3 that is, they live in Him
everlastingly (p. 103 p. 11, l, 1—23).

It is true that St. John Chrysostom punctuates this text differently3
instead of “Quod factum est in ipso vita erat’', he joins “Quod factum
est’' to the preceding sentence, and begins another with “In ipso'’· This
would destroy the effect of the preceding argument. But the Roman
Church follows Augustine's punctuation. This would be decisive as fixing
the meaning of the text, if meant as a dogmatic assertion, or even as
an approbation of St. Augustine's view3 if meant only to declare the
probability of his opinion, we are free to assert it as true (ib., l. 23
to end; p. 12, l. 1—5). I have already pointed out Wyclif’s attitude
of appeal to Rome on this point; though it must be added that Rome
seemed to be in his favour, and -orthodoxy was easy.

Wyclif’s comparison of the Divine Essence to a mirror found,
it seems, more than one opponent3 also his doctrine that the Ideas could
in any way be identified with God. The image in a mirror is not its
essence, but a mere accident. If these Ideas are God, they must be
God formally, like the Word or the Holy Spirit; which would be
a heresy. To this it may be replied that, distinct one from another, they
all share in the Personality of the Word3 or that they all share in God's
essence which is their subject, as corporality is the subject of igneity3
as sire is really a body, so the Ideal World is really God. Yet we must
not conceive them as forms determining God’s essence, since they are
but the exemplars of creatures which He may create. If they are the
forms of anything‚ it is· of those creatures alone. They have no essence
at all of their own, apart from that of God, and it is only as exemplars
that they are conceivable (p. 12, l. 5 to end; p. 13, l. 1—29).

Wyclif goes further, Every such Idea in God is the supreme
measure (ratio) of existence of the creature whose exemplar it is, and
every creature is identical with its own created measure of existence3
a fortiori it must be identical with its uncreated measure (ratio). Therefore
every creature, in so far as it is thus identical, is the Divine Life itself.
