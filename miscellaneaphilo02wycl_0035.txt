INTRODUCTION. XXXI

(8) “Every being is separately numerable3 therefore none can have
being in common with another,” — The same distinction should be made
here as in (7) (p. 104, 1. 31—39).

(9) “Every being is an individua13 therefore there is no universal
Being.³’ -— A like distinction should again be made. That by which
Universal Being is Universal Being — its formal essence — cannot be
shared with many3 and if you call that alone individuality‚ nothing follows.
But if you say that Being is individual‚ meaning that it can in no sense
belong to many individuals‚ we deny this (p. 104, l. 39 to p. 105, l. 11).

(10) “Every creature would be as identical with God as the Father
or the Son is identical with the Divine Essence.” — It is almost im-
possible to explain the distinction given here without recurring to the
Latin terms used in the text. The Father, according to theologians, is
unum (ens) with the Son; but He is not unus (Pater) with the Son. In
like manner, a horse, for instance is unum (ens) with God, but not unus
(equus) with God. The argument makes the difference between God and
the creature to correspond between that of a Divine Person and the
Godhead: which difference is not real but fictive. Wyclif, on the contrary,
says that it corresponds to the difference between the Persons, which
all Catholic theologians admit to be real (p. 105, l. 11 to p. 196, l. 16).

(11) “If, because every man is a being, there is a Universal Being,
so, because every man is singular, there would be Universal Singularity!
This is absurd.” — Not if properly understood, Truth may be uttered
respecting falsehood, and universality may be predicated of singularity.
But there is no Universal Person3 when we say ‘A Person’, this is a
mere abstraction of the mind3 and as soon as personality is abstracted‚
it ceases to be incommunicable. There is, in different senses, a singular
Universal and a Universal Singular (p. 106, l. 16 to end of chapter).

Chapter XVII. The adversaries urge that, “if the Universal Man
is singular, then it (or he) is identical with the singular man, and there
remains only singular humanity’'. — But this is an equivocation3 for we
do not say that the Universal is identical with its singular taken as an indi-
vidual. We mean no more than: Every man is this, that, or the other
singular, but is not one of them alone’ (p. 108 to 109, l. 3ο). - ‘But’‚
it is said, ‘what does this, that, or the other stand for? It must be for
one or more singular men, or for nothing at all; if for the first, your
Universal is only so many individuals3 if for the second, it does not
