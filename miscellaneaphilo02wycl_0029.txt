INTRODUCTlON. 'XXV

and with the very same argument3 an oversight that we may consider
as a further proof of the youthful inexperience which he confesses, A
few remarks on genera more or less general, and species more or less
special, serve to conclude the chapter (p. 62, l. 52 to end3 p. 63).

Chapter XI. The writer now comes to Specific Difference, by
which the genus is divided into species3 and he thereupon treats of
divisions. No genus can be adequately divided by means of one division
alone3 and the same may be said of definitions, which contain the
dividing term, affirmed or denied (p. 64). Wyclif here alludes to what
are called cross-divisions, as the example he gives shows plainly. The
number three is odd, prime, and incomposite3 that is, not produced by
the addition of other numbers (unity not being considered as a number).
The example is from Aristotle3 but it seems that ‘prime‘ is an unneces-
sary division; only two numbers, 2 and 3, are ‘incomposite’ in the sense
stated. And ‘odd’‚ if we add it to ‘incomposite‘, leaves the number 3,
whether we add ‘prime' or not (p. 65, l. 1—21).

This theory, however, is exposed to considerable difficulties The
principal is that by introducing more than one principle of division, the
genus is divided into species which overlap, instead of excluding each
other. Wyclif's manner of putting it (p. 65, l. 21 to end3 p. ὁὸ, l. 1-13)
is somewhat obscure. It may be thus explained: Cross-divisions introduce
differences which are not essentially contained within the genus. If we
divide animal, v. g. by two differences which are independent of each
other, such as large and beautiful, and these by others of the same
sort, we can never get to the ultimate species. This does not explicitly
state that the divisions overlap within the genus, but that they may
contain what is beyond it. As a fact, if not comprised within the genus,
they will overlap3 some animals will be large and not beautiful, others
beautiful and not large In this connection we may quote the words of
Jevons (Elementary Lessons in Logic‚ XII, p. 105—107), who takes the
side opposed to Wyclif: “The division must be founded upon one prin-
ciple or basis. It would be obviously absurd to divide books into folio,
quarto, Freneh, German, and dictionaries, because these speeies overlap
each other, and there may be French or German dictionaries which
happen to be quarto or solio and belong to three species at once. A
division of this kind is said to be a Cross-Division, because there is
more than one principle of division, and the several species in con-
