XXVI INTRODUCTION.

sequence cross each other and produce confusion ..... But when sub-
division is employed, and each of the species is considered as a genus
which may be subjected to 3 further separation, a new principle of
division may and in fact must be employed each time ..... The most
perfect divisions in a logical point of view are produced by continually
dividing each genus into two species by a difference, of which an example
has been given in the Tree of Porphyry. This process is called Dicho-
tomy ..... ; it is also called Exhaustive Division ..... ”

To answer this, Wyclif takes the case of quantity, which is either
continuous or not, either having position in space or not. If continuous
and having position in space, it includes all mathematical bodies3 if con-
tinuous without position, it is Time, or Duration. Non-continuous quantity,
having position in space, is inconceivable (universaliter negatur, p. 67,
1, 25, 26); we have, therefore, only a third species, number, which is
non-continuous and without position in space. Now ‘continuous’ and
‘having position in space’ are not by themselves species in regard to
quantity, and genera in regard to the three subaltern species enumerated3
for if they were, they would exclude each other as species, and not
have the same species (i. e. mathematical bodies) included under them
both as genera. The three species, therefore, though produced by these
cross-divisions, are directly subalterns to quantity. We can take them as
they are3 each has a proper difference that belongs to no other. One
is ‘continnons and having position in space’,· the second is ‘continuous
without position‘,· the third is ‘neither continnons nor having position’.
And this is all we want to distinguish them essentially from one another,
the divisions do not by themselves constitute an essential difference, but
only when taken together (p. 66, l. 12 to p. 69, l. 3). A difference may
be said to belong only to one species or to many, according as we
consider all the cross-divisions which make it up, or only one of them3
or as we consider it in itself or together with its opposite; or lastly if
we think it as the difference from one species to another, or between
them. These two last views, however, as Wyclif admits, do not agree
with Porphyry's standpoint‚ when he states that a difference expresses
the howness of many different species (p. 69, l. 3 to p. 70, l. 23).

Chapter XIV. Here the author begins to treat of accidents. These
can only improperly be said to belong to genera and species. For though
‘whiteness’ may be said to determine the genus ‘colour’, it determines
