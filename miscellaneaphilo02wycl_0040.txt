XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

natures have Universals, these cannot be more perfect3 which contra-
dicts what has just been said. Most writers deny that this image exists
in the human soul, for then it would be, like the Trinity‚ Three Persons3
and the Word of God united to the human soul in Christ would be also
three personS. But the fact is that the Church, having for very good
reasons chosen to call the Uncreated Three by the name of persons,
and not the Created 'l‘rinity⁷ we may either call the latter so or not3
there is nothing derogatory to God in doing so (p. 139 to p. 142, l. 25).
As to Christ, if we call the parts of a soul persons, we must assume
that when united to the Word, they lose their hypostase53 if not, we
may simply call them constituents: it does not follow that what is a
Person in God must necessarily be a person in man (p. 142, l. 25 to
p. 143, l. 14). At any rate, the argument first stated fails. If each man
is the image of God, the Universal Man, being each singular man, is the
image of God many times repeated, and therefore far more perfect. This
as regards natural perfection3 as to supernatural entity, a singular may
be more perfect than the Universal (p. 143, l. 14 to end of chapter).

Chapter XXIII. Wyclif now at last answers the twelfth difficulty,
which tends to show that Universals‚ doing nothing and being of no
use, are mere superfluous monsters. This he denies. For firstly they are
the formal causes of things, It would be impossible for any singular
being to exist without them, since the singular is implied in the Universal.
They are also final causes. The non-existence of Man would mean the
non-existence of any singular man, and not vice versa3 therefore the
former does not exist forvthe latter, but the latter for the former; and
as the non-existence of Man would be a far greater evil than the non-
existence of any particular man, the existence of the former is a far
greater good than that of the latter (p. 145 to 147, l. 26). Also, they
are, in a sense, efficient causes. ‘Man³ does what his singulars do, i, e.
in his singulars, though not in himself, They are not properly agents,
however, nor need they be. In themselves they do not act, but in their
state of union with individuals, the acts of these may besam to· be
theirs, since they are the principles of the individuals. Therefore they
are exceedingly useful‚ and far more so than their individuals (p. 147⁷
l. 26 to p. 150, l. 4). Universal man is a bond of common humanity
between s-man and man, and we should rejoice that this bond exists
(Vp. 450, l. 4—17>. Wyclis ends the chapter and the work by declaring
