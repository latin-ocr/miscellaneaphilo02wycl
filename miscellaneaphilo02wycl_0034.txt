the effect. He is, therefore, more universal as its cause3 it is more
universal in predication only. The mere universality of a predicate does
not argue its perfection‚ Perfection, however, generally follows3 and
always in the case of creatures, if the predication be formal (i. e. essen-
tial to the subject) (p. 95, l. 12 to end of chapter).

Chapter XVI. (3) “Transcendent Entity‚ being caused, cannot be God7
the uncaused3 yet it is God, according to this theory'‘. — a) In so far as it
is caused, it is something that is not-God3 but we cannot conclude thence
that it is simply not God, i. e. that its idea excludes that of God, b) It
comprises non-Deity, but it comprises Deity also. c) The argument would
only have weight if we were so absurd as to maintain that the Universal
is formally singulm-3 for the Singular alone is unable to be predicated
at the same time of contradictory subjects. The answers h) and c) are
the best, but a) is simplest, and suffices: and these answers show us
where we can argue from the affirmative, A is a not-B, to the negative,
A is not Β, and where we cannot (p. 99—p. 102, l. 30).

(4) “The goodness of any being would be infinite, since it has
Trancendental Entity'’. — Not if the possession be only partial and
finite. But the adversary retorts that this either means: A thing is at the
same time finitely and infinitely good (since ‘to have infinite goodness’
is ‘to be infinitely good’), or means nothing. We deny this; to have
goodness is not the same as to be good. And if he insists, then we say
that no creature can have infinite essential goodness (p. 102—-103,
l, 36).

(6) “God and a stone would be one, since they would have
absolutely the same entity'’. —- If ‘absolutely’ is meant to determine the
thing which is Transcendental Entity‚ we have merely the statement that
one and the same thing is a stone, and is God. If it is taken to deter-
mine the affirmation of identity7 then a stone would be (Στοᾶς a heresy
which we deny (p. 103, l. 36 to p. 104, l. 11).

(7) “There would be only one Being, since Entity is numerically
one, and all things would be identical therewith''. — But ‘numerically
one’ means in the usual sense a being that is one and cannot exist in
many numerically distinct individuals3 in that sense we must deny that
Entity is numerically one. Entity is one in itself¹ yet may be shared by
many; and if that is meant by ‘numerically one’‚ the argument sails

(p. 104, l. 11—31).
