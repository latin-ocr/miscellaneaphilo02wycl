INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

that in view of the great advantage which accrues to us thereby, no
one should deny the Universals, if not certain that they do not exist,
and it is impossible to attain such certitude. Men who have a common
board (this looks like a hit at some monastic opponents) ought not to
be so set against a common humanity. “For myself‚'' he says, “1 rejoice
to share therein‚ and I feel that it deserves far more praise and love
than my own individuality.'‘

111. Analysis of the Fragmenta.

As the writer declares on p. 256, l. 16, 17, “Suppono quedam
tradita in 3⁶³⁰ tractatu loyco Magistri Johannis Wyclif,” we are, as I
said before, entitled to regard these pages as at least inspired by the
Master, though written by a disciple. But nowhere else in his printed
works does Wyclif give such desperate and uncompromising directions
for the defendes iu an exercise of ‘Obligations‘3 and most likely they
were only for use in cases of extreme danger, and when the defender
was very hard pressed. I have already stated at some length (Logica,
vol. I. Introduction, pp. XXVII—XXX) what I suppose this exercise to
have been, and need not repeat it here.

There are three modes of answering in the Exercise of Obligations.
The first consists in admitting the premises of the syllogism separately‚
and denying them, if taken together so as to form a copulative. And if
they be not thus taken together, it is still possible to deny the con-
clusion of any syllogism; for it is impossible to prove that the conclusion
is right without a copulative proposition, which can always be denied
(Ι). 152 to 153, l. 26). This looks a good deal like an abuse of dialectical
subtlety; for then any argument, however powerful, might be rendered
worthless. For instance: “All men are mortal ancl Englishmen are 1nen’'‚
might be denied, whilst we admit each of the parts separately3 and it
becomes very hard indeed to prove the copulative syllogistically when
there is no direct ‹lenial of its parts. And the writer remarks (p. 154,
l. 30—35) that this and the following mode of defence are available
not only in Obligations, but in other arguments <indifferenter in casu vel
extra casum). But no doubt it was a convenient way of getting out of
a tight place.
