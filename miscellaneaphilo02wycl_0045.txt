INTRODUCTION. XLI

116 defines substantial and accidental form, and draws certain corollaries
from these premises‚ which no doubt were to serve for the full solution:
but the first part 6011165 10 311 end 11616, and we find nothing more on
the subject.

Second Part (p. 173 to the end 011116 work). Here we have two
questions answered, The 11151, 15 (p. 173, l. 2, 3) Whether the Universals
have only ideal being in the Divine Mind3 the second seems to be, so
far as I can judge, XVhether the Universals are really distinct from their
singularS. To the first he answers (p. 173, l. 3, 43 p. 175, l. 14, 15)
that we must admit the Divine Ideas 01 311 things3 and (p. 173, 1. 38,
39) that every creature, in its intelligible being, is God. He nowhere
states explicitly 11131 1116 [1311615315 have only ideal Being in God; but
this is easy to gather from the whole sense 01 p. 174. —— As 10 1116
second question, he on p. 179, l, 4, 5, after having described the various
sorts 01 Universals‚ and enumerated the various opinions concerning
1116111, declares (listinctly 11131 there is no Universal that 15 16311)ν and
essentially different from its singulars. Such an opinion 15, perhaps
wrongly, ascribed 10 Plato by Aristotle. Yet the Universal has 311 entity
01 115 own, and differs from its singulars by 3 10111131 difference only;
but 63611 Universal differs really from every other.

Such are 1116 five 113613165, or fragments 01 tractam-33, which 316
now published. Either by reason 01 111611 original imperfections, or by
those which the copyists have introduced, they 316 131 1655 easy to
analyze than the works contained in the first volume, Yet even the short
and inadequate analysis which I have given shows here and there many
ssashes of profound thought, not unworthy (11 1116 great thinker who
wrote these 113613165.
