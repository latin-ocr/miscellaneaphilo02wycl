INTRODUCTION. XIX

The Universal nature of Man certainly must be somehow before we can
abstract it. But the question is, How is it there? Just as it is in our
minds and after we have abstracted it, or otherwise? It is sufficient to
suppose that it is there indeed, but in potentia, notin actu, as something
merely capable of being abstracted, of being thought as the One in
Many. This capability of being thus thought is reah the being actually
thought as One in Many is notional. What Wyclif has to prove is that
this real aptitude, existing in many individuals7 of being embraced in one
idea, is one and the same quality in itself‚ and not as many qualities as
there are concrete beings. The redness of one poppy and the redness
of another are two concrete determinations of each ssower, but such
that we, seeing them, may form thence the general idea of redneSS. To
say that this redness is one and the same identical reality, universal in
the flower as it is in our thoughts, is to go too far.

It is quite *possible (if we remember how universally dominant the
system of Nominalism was in England at that time) to suppose that
Wyclif may never have had the opportunity to speak with a philosopher
holding these moderate views‚ and his misconception of the theory is
therefore easily accounted for. He goes on to say that philosophers
who deny metaphysical universality to things, and only admit logical
universality, should not be listened to; and he boldly counts (with a
restrictive forte indeed) Aristotle himself amongst these (p. 39, l. 3—22).
But the Greek philosopher’s dictum (Universale animal aut nihil est, aut
posterius est singulari) whilst it certainly militates against Wyclif's system,
may be explained with the greatest ease in the sense of St. Thomas
and his fossowers, if we take into account Aristotle's other sayings and
the general drift of his theory os cognition.

Our author proceeds to show other shortcomings in this view, as
he understands or misunderstands it. It would confound metaphysical
with logical truth; yet God made the one first, and allowed men after-
wards to know it by means of the other. It would imply the denial of
an essence which is common to many species, as happens in the case
of a genus (for instance, the essence of Animal is common both to Man
and to Brute). And it would entail the refusal to admit that primordial
matter exists, save when considered as such by abstracting it from its
forms (p. 39, l. 22 to end3 p. 40, l. 1—12). — All these difficulties

are set aside by the preceding distinctions
