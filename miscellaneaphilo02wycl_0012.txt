VIII INTRODUCTION.

H. Analysis ot the De Universalibus.

Chapter I. (pp. 1—6.) Wyclif begins by proving the existence of
Real Universals from the doctrine of Divine Ideas, or ideal archetypes
of all created things, eternally existent in God. It is probable that this
proof, placed first here, was also first in order of time amongst the reasons
which led to his conversion to Realism from the prevailing Nominalism
of the Oxford Schools. The discrepancy‚ not to say the contradiction,
between the doctrine of the World of Archetypes (so general amongst
the early Fathers that it was almost a dogma of the Church, so univer-
sally admitted that St, Augustine did not hesitate to say: “He who denies
them is an infidel’‘> and the tenets of Nominalism⁷ must have struck
Wyclif from the first. For these patterns of things, or Archetypes‚ where
and what are they? They are in God’s mind, and therein endowed
with eternal existence and reality3 they correspond to the many indivi-
duals in the created world — the Ideal man to the multitude of created
man, and so forth: therefore they are Universals. To deny them were
to stand convicted of infidelity by the authority of Augustine3 but as soon
as Wyelif's youthful mind accepted them, he accepted them with all the
consequences that he thought they contained. God certainly knows man
not only as this or that particular man, but in his essence as a human
being3 and all other beings likewise (p. 2, l. 20 to p. 3, l. 25). This
cannot be identical with the essence of any individual as known by God,
since it applies equally to all individuals, and they therefore cannot be
its proper and distinct object. What then is that distinct object? It can
be nothing else but Created Humanity, eternally known by God as
Creatable Humanity. And if the Idea is of something, surely it is of
something real; and if the Idea of the Particular and of the Universal
Man are distinct, no doubt the Particular and the Universal Man must
be distinct also, unless we deny truth to these Divine Ideas (p. 3, l. 25
to p. 4, l. 5). These, having for objects things which are distinct, must
be distinct one from another, though not from God (p. 4, l. 4—14);
must be distinct {rom their objects, since the copy cannot be the same
as the pattern (ib-7 l. 14—22), and cannot be denied, if we admit that
God knows all things from all eternity (ib.‚ l. 22—38).

Chapter II. The Divine Essence is as it were a mirror in which
all possible created things are reflected‚ and this reflection is the Ideal
