INTRODUCTlON. XV

Moreover, to deny Universals is to deny Scripture. In Genesis it
is said that God created animals in their genera and species, This cannot
mean ‘according to their Archetypes³‚ since ‘in’ is not synonymous with
‘according to'. Nor does it mean our ideas or the words we use to
signify them3 nor the multitude of particular animals that have existed
or will exist, since God did not create them all at that time. The words
must stand for the essential rcsemblances of things, which are in the
things, and afford a foundation for classification; if not, they are utterly
unmeaning (p. 27, 1. 34 to end of chapter).

Chapter VI. Universals are thus the intrinsic formal causes of par-
ticular beings. If it seems hard to think that one formal cause can exist
identi-cally in many particulam, remember that many such particulars may
have one and the same efficient, final and material cause: why make an
exception for formal causes alone? The adversaries will here quote
Aristotle: Form is that which separates and distinguishes. This is true;
but form separates those things which have it from those which have it
not; it joins together all those of the same species, As we know, the
loss of a form entails separation and dissolution in the beings which
lose it. 'I‘hose who say that a form cannot exist in more than one being
would curtail God's Omnipotence. Not only one particular sire but all
fire is fire; every peasant knows that, and thus tacitly admits a universal
Form of igneity. He does not indeed explicitly assert it, nor does he
know anything about the proposition affirming it; all the same he knows
perfectly well that the thing is true. And even learned men who verb-
ally deny the existence of Universals are often forced to admit them as
a matter of fact (p. 29—p. 31, l. 28).

Indeed, a universal fact (All fire is fire) is more certainly known
than its particular <This fire is fire); and if it were not so, no principle
of science would be more sels-evident than the particulars deduced there-
from. In fact, those principles would be no more than mere aggregates
of particular propositions‚ and there would be no inference at all. But
they exist, and whether known and uttered by us or not, they are inde-
pendent of the facts which they determine. Really‚ there is no need to
prove this, nor is it possible to reason with an adversary who denies
the objective existence of light, colour, sound, etc. Being in general, and
sensible Being in particular, once admitted, open the door to the ad-
mission os the Universal. To deny it is like denying the Principle of
