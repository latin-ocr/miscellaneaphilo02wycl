INTRODUCTION. VII

De Materia is so mutilated that it is difficult to form any judgment
at all concerning it. Its authenticity, so far as I can see, amounts to
this: We have no reason to believe that it is not by Wyclif, since it is
his doctrine, and written in a style indistinguishable from his. It is true
(see Note, p. 170) that a work ascribed to Johannes Huss de Hussynetz
has the “incipit” and the first page, but the first page only⁷ identical
with this work. But Huss, as has been amply shown by Dr. Loserth
more than once, was what we moderns would call a plagiary of Wyclif;
and the circumstance that only the first page is identical seems rather
to show that Huss borrowed it from the present tractate, and that this
tractate is by his master's hand.

Fragmenta, as I found when copying the last lines (p. 156,
1. 16—17) are by another author. Nevertheless, these fragments are quite
in their place here. They were evidently written by some disciple⁷ who
in all probability copied them with insignificant additions from some
of the lost works of Wyclif.

Notae et Qnestiones Variae have about as much authenticity as
De Materia, save that De Materia alone is mentioned in Shirley's Ca-
talogue. A point in their favour is also the fact that one of these
“Notae'’ is identical with one of the Questiones Tredecim, already pu-
blished with De compositione Hominis.

We may set aside the question of the dates of these last short
tractates as impossible to answer, but that of De Universalibns may be
approximately fixed. Granting that it is by Wyclif, it is certainly earlier
than De Actibus Animae, itself earlier than Logica. The admission of
“Absolute Accidents”‚ already mentioned, which Wyclif combated during
the whole of his subsequent career, seems to be a sufficient proof of this;
besides, there are indications here and there in the work that the cosmo-
logical system of “punctal atoms''‚ so carefully elaborated in Logica‚
which (as we have elsewhere shown) clashes with the idea of accidents
separated from a substance and finally comes into collision with the
doctrine of Transubstantiation itself‚ was not yet fully developed. As
Ι showed in Miscellanea‚ vol. Ι, p. XXXIII, De Actibus Animae was not
much, if at all, anterior to Wyclif's Mastership at Balliol College. It is
very probable that the present work was written by him when an under-
graduate3 though of course the precise date cannot be ascertained.
