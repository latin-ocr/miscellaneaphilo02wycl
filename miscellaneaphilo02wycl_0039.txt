Chapter XX. Possibly following up the idea of ‘abstract Universals’,
Wyclif now proceeds to state that some are simply real, some potentially
real, and some merely conceptual, or pure abstractions. There is only
one sun, but by a miracle there might be many. The sun is therefore
a potential Universal‚ which in the ordinary course of nature exists only
in one singular, If we admit St. Thomas' doctrine that each angel is of
a different species which cannot possibly exist in more than one individual,
we shall still be able to conceive the Universal of each species of angel,
though this is only Universal in our minds (p. 127, l. 1—27). Thus
there are three degrees of Universality‚ from greatest to least: actual,
potential, and merely conceptual; though these degrees have nothing to
do with the entitative perfection of the singulars. Of the last (conceptum)
we may say that we ought to follow the doctrine of St. Thomas con-
cerning Angels, and consequently admit in their case only conceptual
universality. These three degrees are in close connection with the degrees
of essential differcnce above mentioned (p. 127, l. 27 to end of chapter).

Chapter XXI. Wyclif returns to the question already dealt with
before, viz„ whether there can 136 any Universal which is never existent
in any of its singulars, and he proceeds hereupon to classify the ten
categories — substance and the nine sorts of accidents‚ which are the
substance as perfected in three ways (quidditatively‚ qualitatively, and
quantitatively) and in three degrees (little, more, and most). These,⁴ com-
bined, give nine determinations of Substance3 but it is very difficult —
if we admit (though this is doubtful) that the Nine Categories of Aristotle
rightly correspond to these divisions of Substance -—- to show how and
in what sense they correspond; we may let the question drop (p. 131
to p. 135, l, 30). Notwithstanding we can show that there must be ten
categories and not more, but omit for want of space many arguments
by which this division can be proved (p. 135, l. 30 to p. 137, l. 13).
Now these ten categories have under them 51366165 of which they consist3
and if any species were wanting, they would therefore be mutilated3
which is contrary to God's wisdom and power. But certain 51366165 will
not exist after the Day of Judgment (p. 137, l. 13 to end of chapter).

Chapter XXII examines whether Universals have more perfect entity
than their respective singulars. It must be so, for no number of singulars
can equal the perfectiori of the species. Yet the individual Man, not the

UniversaL ,is the image of God and of the Trinity. If then intellectual
