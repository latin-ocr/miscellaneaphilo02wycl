XVIII INTRODUCTION.

mitting that many great philosophers (multos famosos, p. 37, l. 12) held
the opinion which he thinks is inadmissible, and even quoting one of
the greatest, Aristotle (p. 39, l. 8, 9). It seems therefore advisable to
analyse the paragraphs from p. 37, l. 12 to p. 40, l. 12, with special
care, not omitting to give (where necessary) the replies which might be
made by upholders of this doctrine, so as both to show the difference
between Wyclif’s system and theirs, and to point out the misconception
under which Ι think he laboured.

Many great writers compare the Universal with Primordial Matter,
in so far as the latter is never bereft of all forms, and is only conceived
as thus bereft by the act of our mind which can think it without thinking
of them. In like manner the nature of a thing does not exist apart from
its concrete conditions of existence, but may be thought apart from-them
by the mind3 its universality is therefore a mere abstractim, and a fiction
produced by our intellect (p. 37, 1. 12—30). Moderate Realists, admitting
the greater part of this exposition of their theory, would dissent from
its conclusion, or at least point out a distinction here. Universality, for-
mally considered, is indeed a mere abstraction; but that from which we
abstract is truly and really such that we are enabled to think it as uni-
versal, The resemblances between beings exist before they are thought
of as resemblances3 before they are actually joined together by one
general idea, they are in themselves and truly capable of being thus
joined together. They are indeed not universal in the way that our
notion of them is; but they supply the basis in fact of that very univer-
sality‚ which we therefore cannot call a mere fiction.

Wyclif admits that there is in the mind an act of abstraction by
which the Subjective Universa17 or the general idea, is formed. But he
rejects the comparison with Primordial Matter as quite worthless. As a
fact, Matter exists‚ not in time indeed, but in its nature, previously to
any of its determinationS, and this separate existence does not by any
means depend upon our thought of it. Now the same may be said of
UniversaIS. The nature of man (or Humanity) for instance, exists (not
indeed in time but in its essence) previously to any individual man3 when
we abstract from individuals we do not make Humansty, we only find it.
The truth of things cannot depend on the truth of our thoughts con-
cerning thern (p. 37, 1, 30 to p. 39, l. 3). -- To this the reply would
probably be that all Wyclif says here is quite true, but beside the mark.
