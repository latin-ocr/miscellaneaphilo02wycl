VI INTRODUCTION.

Ι. The Manusoripts, authenticity and dates of the
works.

De Universalibus and Fragmenta take up from f. 19:5¹³ to f. 259b of
MS. IV. H. G. of Prague University. Notae extends from f. ι· to the end
of f. 4¹³ (Univ, Prag. III. G. 10), with the exception of lb and the
greater part of 2¹², which has already been published (see Note, p. 158).
De Materia begins with f. 135a of the same MS. and ends on f, 139b.
A full description of both the MSS. will be found in the Miscellanea
Plzttosophica, Introduction, pp. LXIX, LXX.

As to their authenticity, we must first state that only De Uni-
versalz‘bus and De Materia are noticed in Shirley’s catalogue3 I copied
the others in Vienna, on the chance that they might be portions of the
lost works of Wyclif‚ and acting under Dr. Furnivall's advice. There
are a few peculiarities about De Universalibus which differentiate it
from the other works of Wyclif. One is the great number of mistakes
in grammar, some of which seem certainly ascribable to the writer
and not to the copyist3 another is the frequent recurrence of certain
expressions (such, for instance, as cum tunc) which are rare in the
other works. The writer's attitude towards the Roman Church (see
p. 11, l. 30—35) and his assertion that God can, if He chooses,
preserve accidents in being without their subjects (p. 78, l. 29—33)
—— an assertion which Wyclif‚ even in so early a treatise as De Actibus
Animae, assailed with great vigour — may also incline us to doubt
whether this tractate was really by him, although by far the greater part
of his philosophical system is to be found therein. But we recognize
here, not only the doctrine, but the power and subtlety of Wyclif; and
the old argument: If not by Wyclif‚ then by whom? naturally presents
itself since we know of no Realist contemporary worthy of mention
by his side. As to the above stated points, they are easily answered
if we note (p. 137) that the writer excuses himself for his inexperience
which has made him diffuse, and write, he says, “satis pueriliter”. And
a few lines lower he again alludes, not without a touch of pride, to his
“pueriles deductiones”. If we assume that we have here Wyclif’s very
earliest work extant, mistakes of grammar, awkwardness of repeated
expressions, orthodoxy as concerns Rome, ,andeven his belief in. ‘fab-
solute accidents” are all explained. For my own part, I have no doubt
that the work is authentic.
