INTRODUCTloN. XXXIII

this is hard to understand, even by philosophers (difficillime a philosophis
et sicut impossibiliter a grossis est secundum hunc modum apprehensibile,
p. 112, l. 34, 35); and Ι willingly admit that the general drift os this
passage seems very obscure. Continuing his comparison with matter, he
remarks that as matter may be manifold, so there may be many such
vague, particular, yet not singular, objects. This passage too, at such a
distance of time and without the means of knowing any more about the
question than our author chooses‘to say, - seems to me ‘difficillime
apprehensibile’3 and as I srankly consess in a foot—note (p. 113) con-
cerning the two following paragraphs, Ι must rank myself amongst the
grossi, to whom the apprehension of these things is as it were impossible
(p. 113, l. 11 to p. 114, l. 40). The chapter closes with some further
remarks about Particularity, as distinct both from Singularity and from
Universality‚ properly so called (p. 114, l. 40 to p. 115, l. 30).

Chapter XVIII. The first ,three pages (p. 115 to p. 118, l. 20
are relatively without interest, being merely a continuation of the former
remarks, and winding up with the assertion that the difficulty consists in
pointing out what thing corresponds to the truth of disjunctive propo-
sitions, and consequently (I may say) of particular propositions in general.
For a particular proposition, v. g. ‘Some man runs’ is equivalent to an
indefinite number of disjunctiVes‚ containing all the singulars under Every
Man: ‘The man A, or the man B, or ..... the man Z runs. But Ι must
here explain a point which, if left unexplained would seem not far
removed from absolute absurdity. On p. 115, and again on p. 118, Wyclif
declares that a disjunctive may be true when neither of its parts are
true3 and he gives us an example: Ι speak or I do not speak. Now it
looks as if there could be no time when Ι neither speak nor do not
speak. Such, however, is not his meaning. The disjunctive proposition is
true, -- when? Eternally. Now neither I speak nor I do not speak is
eternally true. If we understand thus the “pro aliqua mensura vel aliquo
tempore'’ on p. 116, l. 10, and p. 118, l. 5, ὁ, the whole meaning of
the two passages is quite clear.

At this point, our author examines the question of the inherence
of the Universal in its particulars. As there are three kinds of difference
and of predication, so there are also three degrees of inherence. When
I say: “My right eye or my left is necessary to see”, “Necessary to

see'' belongs in fact either to one eye or the other, but vaguely and
De Universalibus. C
