refuted. “Every thing is singular, and Realists affirm that Universals are
things''. Yes, but they deny that every thing is singular; for Universal
things cannot be singular. “Substauce is identical with ass, and man with
substance’'. But this gives no conclusion, since Substance ought to be,
and is not, taken distributively. One might by a like argument prove
the Father to be the Son. The syllogism is worthless unless we say
<which we do not) that Substance is identical with each particular man
(p. 87 to p. 89, l. 3).

Aristotle expresses himself differently3 a statue, according to him,
is not a stone, but is os stone. But this is only a difference of language:
to be of stone is to be a stone modified in a certain ⁷vay‚· and in like
manner the Father is God from a certain point of view. Any other
manner of arguing lands us in heresy or in absurdity3 or would land us
in heresy were it not for the formal declarations of the Church. They
are therefore, dangerous and sophistica] subtleties (p. 89, l. 3 to end of
chapter).

Chapter XV. Wyclif here formulates (p. 91 to p. 94, l. 6) thirteen
objections, most of them bearing on the doctrine of Transcendent Being‚
common to God and His creature, and proceeds to answer them. We
give the objections together with the answers.

(Ι) “If there is Transcendent Entity, there will be also transcendent
beauty, common both to God and the creature3 for entity and beauty
imply· one another. Every creature would be beautiful with the infinite
beauty of God’³. — We must admit, however, the existence of Trans-
cendent Enffly, since we conceive it distinctly‚ apart from the entity of
particulam, and in thinking of it, we certainly think of something. But
the argument is worthless. The Finite possesses the infinite beauty of
God, but not infinitely (p. 94, l. 6 to p. 95, l. 12). This same distinction
serves also to answer the fifth objecti0n‚ viz„ that God would be no
better than the lowest of His creatureS. For though God and the creature
have the same entity, God has it in an infinitely more perfect manner
than the creature. Besides, He possesses special attributes which He alone
can possess (p. 95, l. 12—30). In the text, the preceding objection is
numbered as the seventh. This is a copyist's mistake no doubt.

(2) “Transcendent entity would be more divine, being universal,
than God Himselffl, — No, for He is the cause of that entity3 and His
own incommunicable Being is anterior to the other7 as the cause is to
