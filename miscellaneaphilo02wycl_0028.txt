XXIV INTRODUCTION.

least universal, and one may, by God's power, be united to another of
a higher or lower rank. This hierarchy is necessary, for the essence
cannot be made up of two or more parts independent of one another,
and consequently accidental (p. 573 p. 58, 1—30). —- To conceive
Wyclif's meaning more clearly, let us take ‘Something animated and
rational' on one hand, and Something large and red' on the other.
‘Rational' depends on ‘animated‘ and is inconceivable without it. A being
may be animated and rational, or animated and not rational, or neither,
but not rational and not animated; whereas we can perfectly conceive
something large and red, or large and not red or red and not large,
οφ· neither. These, as separately conceivable, are accidental to each
other’s essence, whilst ‘animated' is essential to ‘rational'.

As there are three sorts of differences, real and essential, real but
not essential‚ and merely formal difference, so there are correspondingly
three sorts of composition: quantitative, uniting parts really and essen-
tially different, and easily conceivable; qualitative, of matter and form,
which are really distinct, but forming only one-essence as the deter-
mining and determinable parts of the same being (that v. g. out of which
a watch is made, and that which makes it to be a watch)3 and formal
composition, the most abstruse of all, between things which differ neither
really nor essentially. Rati'onality, for instance, added to animation, makes
Man, these are two, but only formally. This composition is very similar
to that of matter, form, and compound, as may readily be seen: and
these formal parts may be called different modes of the same being
(p. 58, 1. 30 to end3 p. 59—p. 60, l. 38).

We can only improperly predicate one of these parts of the other,
and the genus, according to Aristotle, cannot in any sense be predicated
of its difference, for the idea of the latter is outside of the intension of
the former. Animalily and ralionality are, taken together, parts of the
species lzztmanily,· and one part is not another. Thence it follows that
cntity is not a genus, isit were, it would form a lower species by the
addition of something else, extraneous to entity3 but it is clear that
there can be no such thing (p. 60, l. 30 to p. 61, l. 30).

A genus, which belongs to the essence of anything previously to
its species, must at some time or other have all its possible species, for
otherwise it would be mutilated and incomplete (p. 61, l. 30 to p. 62,
l, 32). Wyclif returns to this, idea on p. 137, almost in the same terms
