XIV INTRODUCTION.

Real Universals properly so called3 for God’s Ideas are not only real
beings in a very peculiar sense, but they are also Universals in a very
peculiar sense, i. e. because they influence the existence of many par-
ticulars as their archetypeS. He now proceeds to prove the Universals
proper, viz.‚ those which exist in created things,

Everything good is good and pleasing to God. He sees it and wills
it. But what is it then that He sees and wills? No answer can be given
to this question, other than: That common goodness which is in all
creatures. If we do not admit any common goodness, then God sees
nothing that is common to all; the proposition that “Everything good is
good’‘ becomes unmeaning; and yet it is necessarily true. If, on the
contrary, we admit a common goodness which is in every created
nature as such, we shall by a like reasoning be forced to admit a
common humanity in all men, and so forth. And a denial would subvert
the whole of our Catholic faith and practice, and even obedience to the
King (p. 23—25, 1. 9).

Again, if the Scholastic axiom, that Every Being is good, be true,
it follows that universal goodness belongs to Being. This, known by
God, and including His own goodness, is something neither created nor
increate, but abstracted from the idea of God and of His creatures3 if
abstract7 then universal (p. 25, l, 9—28).

Resides, it is absurd to say that our knowledge of Nature extends
only to the propositions made concerning it; we must know what the
propositions signifiy. Now this is in every case something universal. And
even in practical matters, we know that a groat is worth more than a
sarthing. This is not only a knowledge of the proposition, but of the
Universals, Every grmt, and Every sarthing. A man is universally and
really an animal: can this be, without animal being something universal
and real? No more than there ean be mighty labour without might. ‘A
man being an animal2 depends on ‘All men being animal& (cf. Repli-
catio de Universalihus, W's Miscell. Phil. vol. 1, p. 133); and this is the
dependency of the Particular upon the Universal. We know this by the
dependency osone proposition upon another3 God knows it without their
aid, and directly. If one man had nothing really in common with another,
all men would be as different from each other as men are from stones,
Resemblance cannot proceed from mere particularity, which only makes
one thing not to be another (p. 25, l. 28 to p. 27, 1. 34).
