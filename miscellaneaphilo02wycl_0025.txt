INTRODUCTION. XXI

stwance, we shall find that any Universal predicated thereos is either
predicated of it as a substance or not. If as a substance, either of the
whole substance, and then it is a species, or it is the predicate of another
universal which determines it, and is called genus, or it determines the
genus in the formation of a species, and is a difference. (Example3
Man Ξ species,· animated being Ξ genus; rational z dzfferenca) If the
Universal does not belong to its singular as a substance, it either belongs
to the whole species taken in its abstract essence, and is a property‚·
or to the individual as such, and is an accident (p. 44, l. 11 to end;
p. 45, l. 1 to 16).

God, therefore, though He might be called a Universal if we follow
the old definition (Unum in multis et de multis predicatum) since He is
predicated of the Three Persons, is not to be called so according to
the one given above. He is not predicated of the Divine Persons as a
form existing in several subjects essentially different, since they have the
same identical essence. Being again, and the other Transcendentals (the
Something, the Good, and the True) do not exist in their subjects as
forms in matter, and correspond to none of the five Praedicabilia above
mentioned; so they, though real, are not properly Universals (p. 45,
l. 16 to p. 46, l. 11). Then our definition of the Universal as a Form
implies that it limits its subjects; whereas both God and Entity are
unlimited. God, as an absolute actuality, and primordial matter, as a
potentiality equally absolute, are both beyond the scope of the Pre-
dicaments‚ which deal only with substances in which actuality and
potentiality are combined. Units, points, and numbers are like forms in
respect to the singulars which they determine, but in themselves they
rather share the pure potentiality of matter, and so cannot be classed
amonst the Universals (p. 46, l. 11 to p. 47, l. 29). The difficulty as to
whether universal rationality is or is not the form of singular rationality
is met by the assertion that there is no such thing as singular rationality
distinct from the singular man, since a singular man and his humanity
are one and the same (p. 47, l. 29, to p. 49, l. 25).

“But if there is One God in Three Divine Persons, does it not
follow that there is one Man only in many human persons, if we follow
up the theory? This is clearly absurd'’ (p. 49 to end of chapter),
